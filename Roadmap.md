## The Bucket list

* Have documentation for script parameters
* Make the fzf configurable
* Make it possible to configure in .ok what files fzf searches for (use fd?)
* Recent commands and recent args to make running things faster.
* Client/server modes that work through unix pipes and allow specified users (unix file permissions)
  to have access to limited set of actions of other users. Be smart about security.
