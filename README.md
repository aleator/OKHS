# OKHS -- A Command Line Runbook

OKHS is a simple text-mode user interface that stores essential scripts for
your projects. Maintaining services and development work often accrue many scripts
and specific commands that are often necessary but hard to remember after significant
amounts of time. OKHS allows storing these commands files along with their documentation.
The user interface is designed to allow you to quickly select the required commands.
